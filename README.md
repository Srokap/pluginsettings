Plugin Settings Module
======================

Summary
-------
This module is designed to export your plugin settings i.e. the order
of your plugins and any settings saved using standard plugin settings
methods i.e. get_plugin_setting(), set_plugin_setting().

Any module that uses a custom method of saving plugin settings will 
not have there settings exported!

No core settings are currented imported!

You need XMLReader and XMLWriter compiled with your PHP instance. 
XMLWriter is usually included with PHP by default. XMLReader may
not be!

TODOs
